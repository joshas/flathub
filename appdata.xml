      FCEUX is a Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), Famicom, Famicom 
      Disk System (FDS), and Dendy emulator. It supports NTSC (USA/JPN),
      PAL (European), and NTSC-PAL Hybrid modes. It supports both
      Windows and SDL versions for cross compatibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      The FCEUX concept is that of an "all in one" emulator that offers
      accurate emulation and the best options for both casual play and a
      variety of more advanced emulator functions. For pro users, FCEUX
      offers tools for debugging, rom-hacking, map making, Tool-assisted
      movies, and Lua scripting.
