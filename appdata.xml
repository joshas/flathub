      FCEUX is a Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), Famicom, Famicom 
      Disk System (FDS), and Dendy emulator. It supports NTSC (USA/JPN),
      PAL (European), and NTSC-PAL Hybrid modes. It supports both
      Windows and SDL versions for cross compatibility.

      The FCEUX concept is that of an "all in one" emulator that offers
      accurate emulation and the best options for both casual play and a
      variety of more advanced emulator functions. For pro users, FCEUX
      offers tools for debugging, rom-hacking, map making, Tool-assisted
      movies, and Lua scripting.
